Tutorials
=========

Welcome to the ``unit_averaging`` tutorials. These step-by-step guides will help you get started with the package's core functionality and extend it for your specific needs.

Getting Started
---------------

New to unit averaging? Start with the :doc:`Getting Started <plot_1_basics>` page. It covers: 

- An example complete workflow from raw data to optimal averaging.
- Key concepts like focus functions and weighting schemes.
- Essential information about optimal unit averaging.

Getting More
-------------

Once you're comfortable with the basics, see the :doc:`tutorial on defining custom averagers <plot_1_basics>` to adapt unit averaging to scenario beyond MSE-optimal estimation of unit specific parameters.
 
These tutorials are designed to be completed in order, but feel free to jump to specific topics as needed.

.. admonition:: Next Steps

    After working through these examples, you may want to look at:

    - :doc:`Background about unit averaging <../theory/theory>` for a quick reference on the theory of unit averaging.
    - The :doc:`API reference <../reference/index>` for a detailed reference on the classes implemented in this package.
    - The `original paper <https://doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2025.2584579>`__ for complete technical details
